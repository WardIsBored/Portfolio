I started my programming journey at 9 years old on a platform called Roblox. I wrote my first Lua script by following a tutorial on how to manipulate characters in the game.  
Back then, I didn’t imagine I’d make it this far — building apps, automations, diving into cybersecurity. I thought I’d make it big on Scratch and Roblox, but here I am, quickly picking up Batch, C#, Python, Lua, and cybersecurity skills.  

In the near future, I hope to get a Raspberry Pi 5 kit and start experimenting with Linux, Bash, and ARM architecture.  

It’s an honor to share this journey. Although I’d love to dive deeper, I need to wrap things up for now.
